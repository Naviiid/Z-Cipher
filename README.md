About Z-Cipher.

I started this project in 2016, but I wasn't very motivated to learn back then.
A year later (2017) I got my motivation back and I started learning C++, so I was
looking for a project that would suite the things I knew, and I thought, why not the one I tried to
develope one year ago. I went in my Google Drive and found the file that contained the numbers, which
I assigned to the letters used in Z-Cipher.  

Turned out to be a good first project for me!

And yes, I know that this is very simple, but it's my first project
and I'm proud of it! 

Have fun writing secret messages. :))
